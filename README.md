# Diwali_Sales_Analysis_Python
Analyze Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and sales using python in Jupyter noteboook

The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze sales data from a retail store during the Diwali festival period. The project utilizes Python programming language and various data analysis libraries to perform the analysis.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Obtained the sales data for the Diwali festival period from a  CSV file.

Data cleaning and processing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This  involved handling missing values, removing duplicates,                               and converting data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an initial exploration of the data to gain insights and understand its characteristics. Use statistical measures, visualizations,                                    and summary statistics to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.

Feature Engineering: Created new features from the existing data that can provide additional insights. For example, created column 'Age Group' from the existing Age column.

Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to uncover relationships between different variables. This may involve calculating correlations, conducting hypothesis                        tests, or performing regression analysis to identify factors that affect sales during Diwali.

Data Visualization: Created visualizationsin the form of bar plot to present the findings from the analysis. This helps in communicating the insights effectively to                             stakeholders.

Reporting and Presentation: Summarize the analysis findings in a clear and concise manner. Prepare a report or presentation that includes key insights, visualizations, and                             recommendations based on the analysis.

Tools and Libraries:

Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and array operations.


By conducting the Diwali Sales Analysis project, we can gain valuable insights into the sales patterns and factors influencing sales during the Diwali festival period. These insights can help businesses make informed decisions, optimize their marketing strategies, and enhance their profitability during this important period.
